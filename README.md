# Completed Trade Notifier (Roblox)
This is a completed trade notifier for OTB that gives you the value (from rolimon) and the RAP of a trade. This was previously closed source but it is now open source with the GPU License meaning you can not distribute this as a paid product. However, you can add onto it and use it for personal use!
